<h2>Exploring the popularity of Pig and Hive</h2>
<p>Pig and Hive are sometimes compared with one another for their ability to do data manipulations on a Hadoop cluster. There are some important differences. Hive is a direct implementation of the SQL language standard, which gives it a leg-up in terms of user familiarity. I wanted to see how the two compared in the number of posts on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> a popular question/answer site for software developers.</p>
<p>I first found the most popular tag for the associated technologies at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags">Stackoverflow</a>. Then I used the public data explorer on <a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/440749/anonymous-feedback-votes-over-time-on-a-specific-tag?tagname=ocaml&amp;ref=survey-2016#graph">StackExchange</a> and entered the tags as queries. I then downloaded the csv file and brought it in to R for some visualizations.</p>

<p>The number of posts with apache-pig as the tag has plataeued and slightly droped from its peak in 2014. Hive has gained in popularity and has more than 3x the number of posts. Seems like a clear winner for Hive here.</p>

<p>Hiveâ€™s rise is completely dwarfed by the acceleration over the past year and half of Spark. Spark is tagged in twice the number of posts as the general Hadoop tag, a technology it was built upon. This has convinced me to put full effort into learning Spark going forward.</p>
